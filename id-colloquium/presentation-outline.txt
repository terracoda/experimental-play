Title: Designing Inclusive Supports for Non-visual Use of Highly Interactive STEM Simulations

Story

- The use of computer simulations in teaching science has become a key part of science education (Finkelstein et al., 2006).
* There are many players engaged in making science simulations for educational use.
* Text book and learning technology companies make a huge number of science simulations.

- PhET Interactive Simulations, an open source initiative at the University of Colorado, Boulder, is one popular suite of interactive science simulations that are open and free for everyone to use. 
* High quality - based in research
* High use - run over 75 million times a year
* Low on accessibility - PhET Sims are highly visual and designed for mouse interaction, making them particularly inaccessible to students who are blind or have vision loss. 

- Goal of this project: 
* By leveraging advancements in open web technologies create an inclusive PhET simulation that provides an accessible, engaging and effective learning experience for students with vision loss who use a screen reader.                                  
* From iterative design & development create guidelines for making interactive simulations more inclusive.

- Target User 
* Students who are blind or have substantial vision loss and who use a screen reader
* Almost 700,000 students in the US have some kind of vision loss and more than 60,000 students in are legally blind (NFB) 

- Research Background...
* How people who blind form mental models: listen and then interact (Fakrudeen et all 2013; Kurniawan et al 2003;)
* Best practices in keyboard interactions (W3C, WebAIM, Horton & Sloan, Maximova, Raskin) 
* Recent Guidelines for description of dynamic scientific graphics have been helpful (Keane, 2014)

- Findings thus far (demo sim)
* Content Layer Parallel Dom - providing access to essential content
* Content layer & controls are accessible via the keyboard 
* Changing content updated in real time (ARIA-live regions, ARIA-describedby)

Access
* keyboard access across browsers
* keyboard access with some screen readersWhen we turn on the screen readers we experience some take-over of the sim's keyboard commands
** Access to essential static content and some dynamically changing content.

Action
We've witnessed successful interaction that engages the user
  Quotes or clips from interviews:
  "Reset Balloons, no I don't want to do that, I am still playing." 
 
Agency
[with 2 negatively charged balloons on the Sweater] "I want to see what happens if I put one balloon on top of the other." [Balloon repels and moves to the bottom of the sweater.]
 "Now, I'll see what happens when I do the same thing on the wall. [no change] Let's see what happens if I remove the wall?"

- Take Home Messages
* Complex problem space.
* We've based our decisions on web standards, the user and pedagogical principles.
* Through interviews we've gained insight into both the diverse strategies that users employ and the frustrating diverse natures of screen reader technology.

- Future Work & Next Steps (1 minute) 
* refinement and implementation of dynamic descriptions
* implementation of some simple immersive sonification
* deeper investigation of technical the relationship between the content layer (parallel-DOM), sim application and screen readers 


10 minutes is short, so youâ€™ll probably want to limit your findings section (or however you end up structuring it) to 2 main points if they require explaining, or 3 main points if one is super straightforward (and probably obvious). I would also suggest keeping the intro very short - my guess is that people will want to hear about the heart of the work, and can already guess about some of the intro without you saying too much. 


Title: Designing Inclusive Supports for Non-visual Use of Highly Interactive STEM Simulations

Context & Background:
* The use of computer simulations in teaching science has become widespread (Finkelstein et al., 2006).
* The PhET Interactive Simulations of the University of Colorado Boulder is a popular set of Interactive Science Simulations used for teaching STEM education in K-16 classrooms. 
* PhET sims are high in use, but low in accessibility. In particular, there is no access for students who cannot use a mouse or cannot see. 

Research Background 
* Web Standards: we know how to make typical wen content & web applications accessible (WCAG 2.0, WAI-ARIA 1.0)
* Description guidelines for complex STEM images (Rothberg, 2002) and more recently Accessible Dynamic Scientific Graphics (Kyle Keane, DIAGram Center, 2014)
* Molecular chemical diagrams have been made interactive and navigable. Sorge, Lee & Wilkinson have used a similar technique to make static diagrams accessible.

Target User:
* In Canada, half a million people have significant vision loss and every year more than 50,000 lose their sight (CNIB)
* NFB reports that 694, 300 children have a vision loss and that there 60, 393 who are legally blind.

Design Challenge: 
To design inclusive supports for non-visual use of a Highly Interactive Simulation for students with visual loss who engage with a desktop computer using a keyboard & a screen reader.

Goal: an inclusive layer that provides an accessible, engaging and effective learning experience through scientific exploration and discovery.

Balloons and Static Electricity
* Looks simple enough, but once you start interacting with it, you discovering complexity at different levels. 
 
Research Background 
* Web Standards: we know how to make typical wen content & web applications accessible (WCAG 2.0, WAI-ARIA 1.0)
* Description guidelines for complex STEM images (Rothberg, 2002) and more recently Accessible Dynamic Scientific Graphics (Kyle Keane, DIAGram Center, 2014)
* Molecular chemical diagrams have been made interactive and navigable. Sorge, Lee & Wilkinson have used a similar technique to make static diagrams accessible.
 
What is the gap being filled by your project? 
* There are no examples or guidelines when an application as dynamic as a PhET simulation and the interactions have no well-defined path.

Problem 
What problem are you trying to solve? 
* Access: before this project began, there was no access for visually impaired students who use a screen reader. Sim interactions and content were mouse-driven and almost exclusively conveyed through visual means.
* Action: How to make keyboard interactions intuitive and engaging as mouse interactions?
* Agency: Connecting the interactions & the content (auditory description & sonification) that implicitly supports and guides the non-visual learner in their own questioning. (Moore (PhET's Design Philosophy))

Process 
* iterative human-centered design
* constructivist approach to learning

Outcome
What do you expect to achieve in your project?
* content layer - show this as a demo 
* keyboard access on all systems
* Screen reader access on some systems JAWS & IE, NVDA & FF, VoiceOver on El Capitan (Maybe)
* Contributions to PhET's documentation

How will it benefit people other than the target user group, if at all? 
* keyboard access will benefit visual keyboard-only users
* documentation will help PhET's larger goals of making all sims inclusive

What is the original contribution in your work - something no one else has done so far? 
* no one has made such a highly interactive simulation keyboard and screen reader accessible    

Access: Can students access to Sim Controls? Yes!
Action: Can the access engage the students through interaction once they have access to controls? Yes!
Agency: Can students ask their own questions and test their hypotheses? Can they guide their own learning? Yes!

Curbcut at end.
