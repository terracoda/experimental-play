Title: Designing Inclusive Supports for Non-visual Use of Highly Interactive STEM Simulations

Story

- Interactive simulations have become a key part of science education (bigger than PhET)

- PhET is one popular suite of interactive science simulations (high use, but low accessibility)

- Goal: To create an inclusive interactive PhET simulation, and from iterative development create guidelines for making interactive simulations more inclusive

- Researh Background...

- Findings… (you might want to take 1 minute to show the sim and give a very quick walk through, highlighting any features that you’ll be referring to in your findings)

- Take Home Messages...

- Future Work


10 minutes is short, so you’ll probably want to limit your findings section (or however you end up structuring it) to 2 main points if they require explaining, or 3 main points if one is super straightforward (and probably obvious). I would also suggest keeping the intro very short - my guess is that people will want to hear about the heart of the work, and can already guess about some of the intro without you saying too much. 


Title: Designing Inclusive Supports for Non-visual Use of Highly Interactive STEM Simulations 
* Taliesin Smith
* Advising committee: Emily Moore & Clayton Lewis
* Committee: Vera Roberts

Context & Background:
* The use of computer simulations in teaching science has become widespread (Finkelstein et al., 2006).
* The PhET Interactive Simulations of the University of Colorado Boulder is a popular set of Interactive Science Simulations used for teaching STEM education in K-16 classrooms. 
* PhET sims are high in use, but low in accessibility.

Design Challenge: 
To design inclusive support for non-visual use of a Highly Interactive Simulation for students with visual impairments who engage with a desktop computer using a keyboard & a screen reader.

Goal: The goal of the inclusive supports is to provide an accessible, engaging and effective learning experience through scientific exploration and discovery.

Balloons and Static Electricity
* Looks simple enough, but once you start interacting with it, you discovering complexity at different levels. 

Context:
Why is your project important? 
* more and more learning objects and resources are being delivered in a digital format (need stats).
* more and more of these are interactive in nature.
* STEM education is excellent for the development of critical thinking skills (ref).
* X number of students in NA who have a visual impairment (need stat).

Why I chose to work on this project?
* Interested making digital educational tools accessible
* Desire to dive deeper into tough accessibility problems
* Learn how to work on an open source project
* Working on a PhET Simulation was the perfect opportunity for me  

What other related work has been done on the topic? 
* Web Standards are well-suited to making a web application with a well-defined path accessible (W3C & years of work on this)
* Work on making STEM images accessible through description standards (Rothberg)
* Description Guidelines have recently been synthesized and applied to simple Dynamic Interactive Scientific Graphics (charts and graphs) (Keane)
* Accessible Gaming (reference needed)
* Molecular chemical diagrams have been made interactive and navigable. Sorge, Lee & Wilkinson have used a similar technique to make static diagrams accessible.
 
What is the gap being filled by your project? 
* There are no examples or guidelines when an application as dynamic as a PhET simulation and the interactions have no well-defined path.

Problem 
What problem are you trying to solve? 
* Access: before this project began, there was no access for visually impaired students who use a screen reader. Sim interactions and content were mouse-driven and almost exclusively conveyed through visual means.
* Action: How to make keyboard interactions intuitive and engaging as mouse interactions?
* Agency: Connecting the interactions & the content (auditory description & sonification) that implicitly supports and guides the non-visual learner in their own questioning. (Moore (PhET's Design Philosphy))

Who are the people facing the problem currently? 
* students who blind or very low vision

How will they benefit by the solution you are designing? 
* access, engage & learn from the simulation along side their peers
* direct their own learning through active experimentation, rather than having to listen passively to the description of someone telling them what is happening

Who else has tried to solve the same or related problems earlier? 
* people are working on it mentioned above : W3C, Sorge 
* Interactive Chemical Diagrams are the closest example I have found, the molecular diagram does not change. It's static.

Process 
* iterative human-centered design
* constructivist approach to learning

Outcome
What do you expect to achieve in your project? 
* keyboard access on all systems
* Screen reader access on some systems JAWS & IE, NVDA & FF, VoiceOver on El Capitan (Maybe)
* Contributions to PhET's documentation

How will it benefit people other than the target user group, if at all? 
* keyboard access will benefit visual keyboard-only users
* documentation will help PhET's larger goals of making all sims inclusive

What is the original contribution in your work - something no one else has done so far? 
* no one has made such a highly interactive simulation keyboard and screen reader accessible    

Access: Can students access to Sim Controls? Yes!
Action: Can the access engage the students through interaction once they have access to controls? Yes!
Agency: Can students ask their own questions and test their hypotheses? Can they guide their own learning? Yes!
