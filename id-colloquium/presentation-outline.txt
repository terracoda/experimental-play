Title: Designing Inclusive Supports for Non-visual Use of Highly Interactive STEM Simulations

Story

- Interactive simulations have become a key part of science education (bigger than PhET)

- PhET is one popular suite of interactive science simulations (high use, but low accessibility)

- Goal: To create an inclusive interactive PhET simulation, and from iterative development create guidelines for making interactive simulations more inclusive

- Research Background...

- Findings… (you might want to take 1 minute to show the sim and give a very quick walk through, highlighting any features that you’ll be referring to in your findings)

- Take Home Messages...

- Future Work


10 minutes is short, so you’ll probably want to limit your findings section (or however you end up structuring it) to 2 main points if they require explaining, or 3 main points if one is super straightforward (and probably obvious). I would also suggest keeping the intro very short - my guess is that people will want to hear about the heart of the work, and can already guess about some of the intro without you saying too much. 


Title: Designing Inclusive Supports for Non-visual Use of Highly Interactive STEM Simulations 
* Taliesin Smith
* Advisors: Dr. Emily Moore & Dr. Clayton Lewis


Context & Background:
* The use of computer simulations in teaching science has become widespread (Finkelstein et al., 2006).
* The PhET Interactive Simulations of the University of Colorado Boulder is a popular set of Interactive Science Simulations used for teaching STEM education in K-16 classrooms. 
* PhET sims are high in use, but low in accessibility. 

Target User:
Why is your project important? 
* In Canada, half a million people have significant vision loss and every year more than 50,000 lose their sight (CNIB)
* NFB reports that 694, 300 children have a vision loss and that there 60, 393 who are legally blind.

Design Challenge: 
To design inclusive supports for non-visual use of a Highly Interactive Simulation for students with visual loss who engage with a desktop computer using a keyboard & a screen reader.

Goal: an inclusive layer that provides an accessible, engaging and effective learning experience through scientific exploration and discovery.

Balloons and Static Electricity
* Looks simple enough, but once you start interacting with it, you discovering complexity at different levels. 
 
Research Background 
* Web Standards: we know how to make typical wen content & web applications accessible (WCAG 2.0, WAI-ARIA 1.0)
* Description guidelines for complex STEM images (Rothberg, 2002) and more recently Accessible Dynamic Scientific Graphics (Kyle Keane, DIAGram Center, 2014)
* Molecular chemical diagrams have been made interactive and navigable. Sorge, Lee & Wilkinson have used a similar technique to make static diagrams accessible.
 
What is the gap being filled by your project? 
* There are no examples or guidelines when an application as dynamic as a PhET simulation and the interactions have no well-defined path.

Problem 
What problem are you trying to solve? 
* Access: before this project began, there was no access for visually impaired students who use a screen reader. Sim interactions and content were mouse-driven and almost exclusively conveyed through visual means.
* Action: How to make keyboard interactions intuitive and engaging as mouse interactions?
* Agency: Connecting the interactions & the content (auditory description & sonification) that implicitly supports and guides the non-visual learner in their own questioning. (Moore (PhET's Design Philosophy))

Process 
* iterative human-centered design
* constructivist approach to learning

Outcome
What do you expect to achieve in your project? 
* keyboard access on all systems
* Screen reader access on some systems JAWS & IE, NVDA & FF, VoiceOver on El Capitan (Maybe)
* Contributions to PhET's documentation

How will it benefit people other than the target user group, if at all? 
* keyboard access will benefit visual keyboard-only users
* documentation will help PhET's larger goals of making all sims inclusive

What is the original contribution in your work - something no one else has done so far? 
* no one has made such a highly interactive simulation keyboard and screen reader accessible    

Access: Can students access to Sim Controls? Yes!
Action: Can the access engage the students through interaction once they have access to controls? Yes!
Agency: Can students ask their own questions and test their hypotheses? Can they guide their own learning? Yes!
