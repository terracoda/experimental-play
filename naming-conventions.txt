Naming Convention Notes

Conventions for class and id names

id names: using camel case as I am thinking that I would eventually need to use them for js stuff and not styling.

class names: used longer dashed names, but have not done any styling yet.
= description: potentially used for all descriptions
= object-properties: for common lists of properties
= object-interactions: for common menu of interactions
              
Managing focus inside groups
When a user tabs away from a widget and returns, focus should return to the specific element that had focus, for example, the tree item or grid cell. There are two techniques for accomplishing this:
* Roving tabindex: programmatically moving focus
* aria-activedescendent: managing a 'virtual' focus
