Slide 1: Interactive Simulations, Key part of Science education (0.5)

Due to increasing availability of computers, smartboards and mobile devices, the use of computer simulations in the classroom has become widespread (Rutten, van Joolingen, & van der Veen, 2012)
Computer-based simulations allow students to use models to investigate scientific phenomena in different physical scales and timelines, and when when real equipment is not available (D’Angelo et al., 2014)
Simulations have a beneficial effect on student learning (D’Angelo et al., 2014; Rutten et al., 2012)

Slide 2: PhET Interactive Simulations (1)

An initiative started by Carl Wieman (Nobel Prize in Physics, 2001).
Very popular – 75 million downloads a year.
Very high quality simulations - based in research.
Low on accessibility – highly visual and designed for mouse and touch interaction.
Consider a rudimentary experiment in [[Balloons and Static Electricity]]. A student grabs the balloon, rubs it on the sweater and then drags it close to the wall.
Now, imagine how a person cannot see and who does not use a mouse might engage with this simulation in a self-directed exploration.

Slide 3: Goal Project (1)

PhET has embarked on a large project to port all sims to HTML5 and to use modern web technologies to make the sims more inclusive to all students, including students with disabilities. Eventually, there will be many inclusive layers that support the diverse needs of students (Moore, 2015).
My Research focus:
Exploring inclusive design solutions that provide non-visual access to a student using a keyboard and screen reader.
How can the learning experience of students with vision loss using a PhET simulation be made accessible, engaging and effective? 

Slide 4: Target User (1)

Students with vision loss who engage with a computer with a screen reader and keyboard.
To make a PhET Sim accessible this target user:
Understandable & timely dynamic verbal text description
Intuitive keyboard interactions that engage the user with the content, 
complimentary immersive sound effects, or sonfication. 
The students may or may not be working other students with or without vision loss, so we want the interactions and supports to work in way that allows for student collaboration.
Electronic Curb cuts: access for visual keyboard users, and students who use switches and switch-like devices.

Slide 5: Research Background (1)
(maybe show my conceptual research framework here)

How people who are blind listen first, then interact (Fakrudeen et all 2013; Kurniawan et al 2003;)
Web content and typical web applications (online forms or a shopping site) which have a well-defined path to success, accessible. (Caldwell, Cooper, Guarino Reid, & Vanderheiden, 2008; Horton & Quesenbery, 2013; Lisa Pappas, Richard Schwerdtfeger, Joseph Scheuhammer, & Michael Cooper, 2014; Maximova, 2013; Scheuhammer, Cooper, Pappas, & Schwerdtfeger, 2013)
Description guidelines for static scientific images (Barstow, McKell, Rothberg, & Schmidt, 2004)
Recent guidelines for simple interactive scientific graphics (Keane & Laverent, 2014)
All helpful but…PhET sims are unique
No well defined path, because learning is more diffuse
Highly interactive.
Anything we can figure out will be something useful.

Slide 6: Prototype thus far (2) 
(show sim, do same experiment & talk)

Parallel-DOM creates an accessible to content layer
Keyboard interactions - a way to navigate and interact with content
ARIA live regions (web standards) we can update the content layer dynamically as the students interact

Slide 7: Findings thus far (2)

Content Layer Parallel Dom - providing access to essential content
Content layer & sim controls are accessible via the keyboard 
Some changing content updated in real time as the student interacts 
Navigation
P4: [Starts off by looking navigating by section] “Nice, lots of regions...now, I'll look for the Main region.” [Finds it on second go around.]
P1 (Ross): “I generally use the arrow keys to navigate line by line.”
Engagement
P3: [with 2 negatively charged balloons on the Sweater] "I want to see what happens if I put one balloon on top of the other." [Balloon repels and moves to the bottom of the sweater.]...“Now, I'll see what happens when I do the same thing on the wall. [no change]”
Slide 8: Complex problem space (1)
Through iterative design & participant interviews we've gained insight into 
How people who are blind approach interactive simulations running in a browser 
* Like typical web pages, employ known navigational strategies
Authentic, unprompted exploration and discovery by the participants is an indication that the approach we’re taking, of keyboard navigation and auditory descriptions can result in effective, exploratory, learning tools for diverse users.

Slide 8: Future Work & Next Steps (0.5)
Refinement, optimization of dynamic descriptions.
Explore simple immersive sonifications for rubbing, bumping into wall, some charge behaviour.
